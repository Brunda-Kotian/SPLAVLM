Solar Powered Automated Vacuum Lawn Mower using microcontroller and ultrasonic sensor.

This lawn mower is a robotic vehicle that is not only
powered by solar energy but also avoids obstacles and is capable of cutting grass
without the need of any human interaction.
Further since the collection of cutgrass is a tedious and time consuming process, a
vacuum that collects it into a duct would be an even efficient version of traditional
lawn mowers.The grass cutter and vehicle motors are interfaced to a microcontroller
that controls the working of all the motors. It is also interfaced to an ultrasonic
sensor for object detection. The microcontroller moves the vehicle motors in forward
direction in case no obstacle is detected. On obstacle detection by the ultrasonic
sensor it signals the microcontroller and thus stops the grass cuter motor to avoid
any damage to the object/human/animal etc. Microcontroller then turns the robotic
vehicle as long as it gets clear of the object and then moves the grass cutter in forward
direction again.
